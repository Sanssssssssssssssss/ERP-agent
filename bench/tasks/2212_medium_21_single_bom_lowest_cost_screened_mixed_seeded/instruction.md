On-hand finished stock covers 92 units. Any shortfall can be handled with finished-goods buying, in-house manufacturing, or a mix that still satisfies policy.

Across all units covered through new purchasing or manufacturing, keep portfolio-level new-spend margin at or above 29.2% at selling price.

## Background & Policy

* Customer order acceptance will be determined as follows.
* Only accept orders whose budgets cover the full list-price total.
* Accepted orders must allow at least 11 days of lead time.
* Reject or cancel any order that fails those acceptance rules.
* Once orders are accepted, cover them while limiting this cycle's purchasing to as few vendors as practical. When vendor counts tie, keep new purchasing and manufacturing spend as low as possible.
* The combined units covered through new purchasing or manufacturing must clear at least 29.2% portfolio-level new-spend margin at selling price.
* Available finished stock can be used where it helps avoid adding another supplier to the plan.
* Some sales documents may already exist in draft; review existing documents before creating new ones.
* Cancel any already-drafted sales order that fails those acceptance rules.
* Customer budgets are pre-tax amounts.
* Link every accepted Sales Order to the related Manufacturing Orders and Purchase Orders for traceability.
* For finished goods POs, put the SO reference(s) (e.g. S00030 or S00030, S00031) into the origin field ('Source' in the UI).
* For component POs, put the MO reference(s) (e.g. WH/MO/00010 or WH/MO/00010, WH/MO/00011) into the origin field.
* For finished goods MOs, put the Sales Order reference (e.g. S00030) into the origin field ('Source' in the UI).
* In the end, the lineage must be SO -> MO -> PO or SO -> PO for every incoming customer order you accept.
* You must sell this product at List Price.
* On every accepted Sales Order, set the commitment date.
* On manufacturing orders, you must set the start date and the due date.
* If you choose to manufacture, you must procure the components that are not in stock.
* On purchase orders, you must set the delivery date.
* Before releasing anything, read the Internal Notes/comments on stock, customers, vendors, and workcenters.

Fulfillment constraints for accepted orders:
- After an order is accepted, treat workcenter capacity as a hard horizon-wide limit across all products that share the center.
- Check each workcenter's Internal Notes in Odoo for the exact horizon-wide minute limit.
- Assign workcenter on each manufacturing work order.
- For each finished-goods supplier offer used to fulfill accepted orders, respect min/max quantities as horizon-wide totals.
- For each component supplier offer used to fulfill accepted orders, respect min/max quantities as horizon-wide totals.
- Use one consolidated PO per supplier offer when fulfilling accepted orders (do not split a single offer across multiple POs).
- Check each vendor's Internal Notes in Odoo for fulfillment-side maximum order quantity limits.

## Execution Autonomy

Work with full autonomy. Do not ask the user for confirmation, approval, or preferences before acting. Make the best valid plan from the available Odoo data and execute it completely in Odoo. If multiple feasible plans satisfy the constraints, choose the one that best optimizes the stated objective.

# Odoo Environment

You have access to an Odoo ERP instance with the following credentials:

- **Host:** 127.0.0.1
- **Port:** 8069
- **Database:** bench
- **API Key:** stored in `/etc/odoo/api_key`

## How to Access Odoo

You can write and execute Python scripts using the `odoo-client-lib` library to interact with Odoo via the JSON-2 API:

```python
import odoolib

# Connect to Odoo via JSON-2 API
connection = odoolib.get_connection(
    hostname='127.0.0.1', protocol='json2', port=8069,
    database='bench', password=open('/etc/odoo/api_key').read().strip()
)

# Get model proxies
Product = connection.get_model('product.product')
Partner = connection.get_model('res.partner')
SaleOrder = connection.get_model('sale.order')
SaleOrderLine = connection.get_model('sale.order.line')
PaymentTerm = connection.get_model('account.payment.term')
InvoiceWizard = connection.get_model('sale.advance.payment.inv')

# Example: Search for products (use named kwargs)
product_ids = Product.search(domain=[('default_code', '=', 'SPP-001')])
if product_ids:
    data = Product.read(ids=product_ids, fields=['name', 'qty_available', 'list_price'])
    for p in (data if isinstance(data, list) else [data]):
        print(f"Product: {p['name']}, Stock: {p['qty_available']}, Price: ${p['list_price']}")

# Example: Create a sale order
customer_ids = Partner.search(domain=[('ref', '=', 'customer_001')])
so_ids = SaleOrder.create(vals_list=[{
    'partner_id': customer_ids[0],
    'note': 'Urgent order'
}])
so_id = so_ids[0]

SaleOrderLine.create(vals_list=[{
    'order_id': so_id,
    'product_id': product_ids[0],
    'product_uom_qty': 25,
    'price_unit': 450.00
}])

# Example: Confirm sale order
SaleOrder.action_confirm(ids=[so_id])
```

- `sale.order` / `sale.order.line` - Sales orders
- `account.payment.term` - Payment terms
- `sale.advance.payment.inv` - Sales invoice wizard (regular invoices and down payments)
- `purchase.order` / `purchase.order.line` - Purchase orders
- `account.move` - Invoices and bills
- `stock.move` - Inventory movements
- `stock.picking` - Deliveries and receipts
